# Research

CARRE aims to create a validated, multi-scale, multiphysics modeling and simulation capability
to predict and assess the radiation resiliency of electronics. The demands for future engineered systems to withstand normal and extreme off-normal radiation environments, both in space and in terrestrial applications, requires a predictive capability supported by advanced algorithms and software engineering that can take advantage of exascale computing resources. This problem is inherently multiscale and multiphysicsâ€”involving material response to radiation from the atomistic to macroscopic level. Our simulations will be validated by experiments designed, performed, and analyzed by our team. Our research will directly impact exascale computing programs involving stochastic solvers, particle transport, and the understanding of radiation response of electronics in environments of interest to the NNSA.
